                                                    SQL
           
           
           
Sql stands for Structured Query Language
Non procedural Language
Standard Language for dealing with relational data bases 
Sql is used to delete ,update ,insert and search database shortcuts in the databases
Sql keywords are not case sensitive
Semicolon is the standard way to seperate each sql startment and allows more than one sql statement to execute in same call of the server.
Sql deals with (--what--) to do unlike procedural programming languages (how to do)
Sql is a complex language and hence divided into 4 main sub-languages (//DDL ,,DML,,DCL,,TCL//)
Let's see each of it 





                                                     DDL
    
  
 DDL stands for Data Definition Language.
 Most used Keywords are      ----((CREATE,,,ALTER,,,RENAME,,,DROP,,,TRUNCATE))
 
CREATE---Used to create databases or tables 
DROP---drop statement is used to drop a table,column or row  at a time
TRUNCATE---This command deletes the data inside the table but not the table itself
ALTER---The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table. The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various               constraints on an existing table
DROP---drop statement is used to drop a table
RENAME---The rename command is used to change the name of an existing database object(like Table,Column) to a new name. Renaming a table does not make it to lose any            data is contained within it.



Is truncate and DELETE same in SQL?
Both the SQL DELETE and SQL TRUNCATE commands can be used to remove records from a table. However, the DELETE command employs the WHERE clause to specify rows in a table for deletion action, whereas the TRUNCATE command does not use any clause and deletes rows all at once
